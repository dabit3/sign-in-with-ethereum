# Sign ing with Ethereum authentication flow

A basic example of how to create an authentication flow using public key encryption and an Ethereum or EVM compatible wallet that works on both desktop and mobile sites.

### How it works

Using ethers.js, Web3Modal, and WalletConnect, sign into an app and authenticate the user on the server, in our case using a Next.js SSR route, using either a browser wallet or a mobile wallet. This codebase also works on mobile devices, legeraging WalletConnect to connect to your mobile wallet of choice.
